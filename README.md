### Introduction
We plan to build a website that helps users memorize vocabulary or learn other knowledge they wish online with user-contributed content. We’ll maintain databases and provide “book” options for users to learn and memorize “entries” (e.g. English words, pictures of fruits, U.S. states on a map). During learning and memorization, any user can contribute by uploading text, pictures, or audio files as “flashcards” (hints) to help people better remember the entry. During timed quizzes, users can ask for such flashcards.
 
We’ll also provide social interactions among users. Users can “like” the flashcards uploaded by others. They can also add comments on specific entries to have a discussion. Moreover, users can add friends to see their friends’ learning achievements and which books they are currently learning. They can even start a competition against their friends. Also, there will be various scoreboards that display the user rankings of different tasks.
