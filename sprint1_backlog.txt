Sprint 1 backlog (owner: Yu-Heng Lei [yuhengl1]):

* Non-logged-in functions:

- [Bian] Non-logged-in homepage: Simple introduction, website statistics (number of books, entries, users). 

- [Bian] Log in, registration: Same as homework, but the user can also upload a profile image at registration. 

- [Bian] Browse books: Anyone can browse the overview of books and their entries. 

* Logged-in functions:

- [Bian] Logged-in homepage: List recently learnt books, other books by popularity, and website statistics.

- [Bian] View other user’s profile and edit their own profile: Same as homework, but email field is hidden for privacy when viewed.

- [Lei] Create, edit, and delete books and entries: Logged in users can create new books, but only the owner can edit or delete the book or entry.
-- A book overview should contain a cover image, a title, and a short description.
-- After creating the overview, the owner can then create the entries of this book.

- [Gu] Learning mode: The user learns through each entry given the question and answer. User can choose or create new “flashcards” (as hints) they want to help them memorize this entry.
-- Create multimedia flashcards: A flashcard can contain text, an image, and an audio file. The flashcard will appear below the entry along with the author username, profile image, and creation date.

- [Bian] “Flashcard of the Day”: The system will pick a random flashcard of any entry every day at 00:00 and show it on the top of both non-logged-in and logged-in homepages.

- [Lei] Enhance and unify website appearance at each sprint
